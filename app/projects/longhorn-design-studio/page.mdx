I created this Longhorn Design Studio website for my web consulting business. It was built with Next.js 15's new app router and used MDX to power the blog portion of it. Since it's just me for now I opted to go with something simple rather than a more robust content authoring setup with a CMS that would be take effort to maintain.

Vercel aggressively tries to get you to use canary releases that aren't even out yet for some reason. The template I started this project with used Tailwind 4 which was in beta at the time and had no documentation. I had trouble even figuring out how to change the font with Next and Tailwind 4 so I downgraded to the latest Tailwind 3 stable release.

I used Adobe Illustrator to create the website logo and settled on using a dusty yellow as the primary brand color. The hue is sort of reminiscent of an aged newspaper from the wild west era. I used [Motion](https://motion.dev/) (formerly Framer motion) to power the animations on the site and used [Lenis](https://lenis.darkroom.engineering/) for smooth scrolling to give it that high-end agency feel.
